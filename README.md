My First Project of Computer Vision Nanodegree by Udacity - Detection of Facial Keypoints. 

In this project, I built a CNN model for regression of 68 different facial keypoints.

The Project has been reviewed by Udacity and graded Meets Specifications against the 
following [rubric](https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints/blob/master/README.md).

You can find the Udacity Github repository for the project [here](https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints).
